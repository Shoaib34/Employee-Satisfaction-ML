Now, moving to the classical methods. Classical methods, unlike neural
networks, are more fundamental. In this case, we will explore KNeighborsRegressor,
RandomForestRegressor, and Linear Regression. Here's a quick overview of the three:
KNeighborsRegressor predicts the target variable by averaging the values of the k
nearest neighbors. RandomForestRegressor builds multiple trees and aggregates their
predictions to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting. It's important to note that
overfitting occurs when a learning model learns the data too well. Lastly, Linear
Regression fits a linear equation to predict the relationship between dependent and
independent variables.
