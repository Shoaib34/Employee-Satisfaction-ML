In this project, I'll delve into the realm of employee job satisfaction. The primary aim is to
explore how specific work-related variables influence an individual's level of satisfaction.
This investigation could shed light on the factors that might lead to employee
dissatisfaction. Employing supervised learning methods such as Decision Trees,
Random Forest, or Logistic Regression, I'll analyze input values like last evaluation,
number of projects, average monthly hours, and department. The predicted variable
could be associated with the individual's performance or evaluation
