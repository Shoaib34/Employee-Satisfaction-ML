Employee job satisfaction is a pivotal factor influencing workplace dynamics and
organizational success. Understanding the connections between specific work-related
variables and an individual's satisfaction level can provide invaluable insights for
businesses aiming to foster a healthier work environment. This investigation aims to
unravel the underlying factors that contribute to or detract from an employee's
contentment in their job.
The significance of this analysis lies in its potential to unearth critical insights into
the drivers of job satisfaction. By leveraging supervised learning methods such as
Classical Methods, Neural Networks, and SVM, my study will analyze an array of input
variables. In order to get said variables we look at the data used from the kaggle
website and find a dataset on employees-satisfaction-analysis. This dataset includes
last evaluation, number of projects, average monthly hours, and department affiliation,
ect. These variables are expected to play a pivotal role in shaping an individual's job
satisfaction levels.
The predictive variable under examination, satisfaction_levels, is presumed to be
closely linked to individual performance or evaluation. It stands as the focal point for
dissecting the impact of various work-related attributes. By uncovering these
relationships, we aim to illuminate patterns that wield substantial influence over an
employee's satisfaction levels. This exploration not only offers insights but also
empowers businesses to fine-tune workplace conditions and policies, fostering
enhanced employee contentment and bolstered productivity
