  Upon analyzing the results, it's evident that both the Random Forest, KNN and
Neural Network models exhibit lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), indicating
better predictive accuracy. Conversely, the SVM model displays the highest RMSE on
both validation and test sets, indicating the least accuracy in predicting employee
satisfaction compared to the other models. Furthermore, examining the runtime reveals
that the SVM executed the fastest, while the slowest performer was the
RandomForestRegressor.

  It's intriguing to note that my initial assumption regarding the Neural Networks
would take the longest was disproven. The neural network, with only two layers (64 and
32 neutrons respectively), executed faster compared to the Random Forest, which
involves multiple splits in a tree diagram. While the KNN model actually computed on a
much faster rate then the two, its output was relatively the same

  This leads me to the conclusion that the more complex models—Neural
Networks, KNNRegressor and RandomForestRegressor—achieved the best scores. In
contrast, simpler models like SVM and Linear Regression, despite their straightforward
structure, yielded inferior predictions.
  
This entire process highlighted the importance of understanding our objectives
when selecting models. Different problems demand different considerations. Models
that prioritize interpretability over predictive power, like Support Vector Machines
(SVMs), may find preference in scenarios where comprehensibility of the
decision-making process holds utmost importance, such as healthcare diagnostics or
financial risk assessment. Conversely, in contexts where predictive power is paramount
and interpretability is of secondary concern, more intricate models like Neural Networks
or Random Forests could serve as the preferred choice.

  Understanding these trade-offs is crucial in ensuring that the chosen model
aligns with the unique requirements of the problem at hand, ultimately driving more
effective and suitable solutions.

  Employee job satisfaction is a pivotal factor influencing workplace dynamics and
organizational success. Understanding the connections between specific work-related
variables and an individual's satisfaction level can provide invaluable insights for
businesses aiming to foster a conducive work environment. This investigation aims to
unravel the underlying factors that contribute to or detract from an employee's
contentment in their job
