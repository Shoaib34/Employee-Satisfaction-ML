Upon analyzing the results, it's evident that both the Random Forest, KNN and
Neural Network models exhibit lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), indicating
better predictive accuracy. Conversely, the SVM model displays the highest RMSE on
both validation and test sets, indicating the least accuracy in predicting employee
satisfaction compared to the other models. Furthermore, examining the runtime reveals
that the SVM executed the fastest, while the slowest performer was the
RandomForestRegressor.
It's intriguing to note that my initial assumption regarding the Neural Networks
would take the longest was disproven. The neural network, with only two layers (64 and
32 neutrons respectively), executed faster compared to the Random Forest, which
involves multiple splits in a tree diagram. While the KNN model actually computed on a
much faster rate then the two, its output was relatively the same
